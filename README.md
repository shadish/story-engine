Reading the Dwarf Fortress patch notes always makes me wish I'd built something so top-heavy from its conception; the bugs tell a tale of a profoundly complex engine off the rails interacting in ways never intended by the developer.

It seems like a textbook example of how not to design such an engine, and yet sounds profoundly delightful to interact with.

So I thought I'd build my own mess from scratch, one step at a time.
